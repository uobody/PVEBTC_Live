# SPT Live BTC PVE Price
This mod dynamically updates the in-game price of Bitcoin in SPT to match its current value in live Tarkov for the PVE gamemode.

This mod is just an additional update to the first mod from Shardbyte and Amightytank's update to that mod.

- Supports SPT 3.11.0–3.11.x


Bitcoin price data is fetched live from Tarkov Dev​


Stay updated with the current PVE price for Bitcoin


Only mess with config if you understand what you are doing/changing.


Config Features:

updateInterval: 2700 seconds to allow 45 minutes between updates

enableLogging - on by default, this just shows you the price updating in the server console, feel free to disable this.

enableperiodicUpdates - enable or disable the 45 minute timer

enablePriceCaching - Non functioning, I had intended to use the feature so it would have a fallback but as of right now it doesn't function.


Feel free to leave feedback, this is my first mod uploaded.
